# Network Discovery – Basic Port Scanner

## Project Description
This project scans a target IP address to identify open TCP ports, helping understand network exposure and active services.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Socket module
- Threading

## How to Run
1. Execute the scanner:
   python port_scanner.py

2. Enter the target IP when prompted.

## How It Works
- Attempts TCP connections to a range of ports
- Identifies open ports using socket handshakes
- Uses threading to speed up scanning

## What I Learned
- TCP/IP and port concepts
- Socket programming in Python
- Multithreading for performance
- Ethical network scanning practices

## Tips
- Scan only authorized systems
- Use smaller port ranges for faster results
- Threading improves efficiency
